/* Implement a boolean flag using volatile to signal multiple worker threads to stop processing
    Implementation using managed thread pools
*/

/* Notes -
1. Visibility Problems
Without volatile, changes made to flag by one thread may not be immediately visible to other threads.

CPU cores and compiler optimizations may keep a cached copy of flag in each threadâ€™s context.

When the main thread updates flag = false;, worker threads could continue reading the old value (true) and
keep running indefinitely (busy-waiting in their loop), even though the main thread thinks they should be stopping.
